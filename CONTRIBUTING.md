# How to contribute

Respecting the following guidelines for contributing increases your chances of an accepted Pull Request and a very quick review of it drastically. It also makes the process of improving the project much easier and therefore helps it grow much better, more efficient and quicker.

Keeping that in mind, you are kindly asked to respect the guidelines and follow them as closely as possible.

If you still have questions, contact me @ the akito.ooo

This file is based on this [contributing information](https://github.com/SecUSo/privacy-friendly-app-example/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) by [SecUSo](https://github.com/SecUSo).

## Exceptions
These guidelines apply to contributions, that add features, fix bugs or anything along those lines.
If you are just looking for correcting a tiny error, like e.g. a typo or something similarly tiny, then you are allowed to bypass these guidelines and your pull request will be accepted if its content is correct.
	
## Making Changes

* Find an issue that you wish to close. If the issue you wish to close is not 
  present, open it. Make sure that the issue has one of the following labels
  which are set by our team:
  * Bug
  * Enhancement
  * Help wanted
  * No integration planned 
  
    That means the issue has already been reviewed. If you wish to add a 
  translation, opening an issue is not required. 
* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master branch).
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b
    fix/master/my_contribution master`. 
  *	Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units using the English language.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. If the commit
  addresses an issue filed in the Github repository, start the first line 
  of the commit with a hashtag followed by the issue number (e.g. #42).
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all available tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.

### Unwanted Changes

Pull Requests that contain the following functionality will be rejected:
* Any that use of libraries that do not comply the license of this project (i.e. GPLv3, Apache2 or Expat (a.k.a. MIT)).
* Features that are against the described goals of the project.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a Pull Request to the repository of this project.
* Our team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis and assigns a reviewer.  
* After feedback has been given responses are expected within one month. After one
  month the pull request is open to be closed if no activity is shown.
